# Modak test

This test implements a simple app that fetches information from an API and displays it in a list. Every item in the list can be clicked to display more information about it. Finally, the app provides a way to save the information locally to be able to access it offline. The app was developed thinking first in interesting features and best practices, the UI was not a priority üòÖ.

### Used libraries:

- ‚Å†State management: redux, redux-toolkit

- ‚Å†Environment variables: react-native-config

- ‚Å†Localization: react-native-localization

- ‚Å†Dark theme: injected using navigator
- Simple animation: react-native-reanimated
- ‚Å†Notifications: firebase cloud messaging, basic set up using Alerts for foreground notifications and setBackgroundMessageHandler for background notifications (Android working so far since I couldn't get the APN key for iOS from my personal Apple Connect account)

### Features:

- ‚Å†List of items: implemented using a FlatList, the list is paginated on scroll end

- ‚Å†Item detail: detail view for each item, the information inside the view is animated when the view is mounted
- ‚Å†Offline mode: implemented using redux-persist, the app saves the information in the redux store to the local storage and retrieves it when the app is opened again
- ‚Å†Notifications: implemented using firebase cloud messaging, the app receives notifications when the app is in the background and foreground, the notifications are displayed using the Alert component
- Dark theme: implemented using react-navigation, the theme is injected in the navigator and the components use the theme to display the correct colors
- Localization: implemented using react-native-localization, the app supports English and Spanish, the language is selected in a component inside gallery view

### Steps for running:

- ‚Å†Environment:node 18.17.0, react native 0.72.7

- ‚Å†Create .env file in root directory and set the variables provided in the email
- ‚Å†Run yarn start in one terminal
- ‚Å†Run yarn ios --simulator="iPhone 15 Pro" in another terminal
