# Modak test

This test implements a simple app that fetches information from an API and displays it in a list. Every item in the list can be clicked to display more information about it. Finally, the app provides a way to save the information locally to be able to access it offline. The app was developed thinking first in interesting features and best practices, the UI was not a priority üòÖ.

- ‚Å†Environment variables: react-native-config

- ‚Å†Localization: react-native-localization

- ‚Å†Dark theme: injected using navigator
